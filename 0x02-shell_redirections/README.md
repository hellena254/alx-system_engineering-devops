## Shell Redirections

Shell redirections are powerful techniques for managing input and output streams of commands. In this section, I've covered:

- Redirecting standard input (stdin) using `<`
- Redirecting standard output (stdout) using `>`
- Appending output to a file using `>>`
- Redirecting standard error (stderr) using `2>`
- Piping commands together using `|`
- Combining input and output redirections
