## Shell Variables and Expansion

Shell variables allow us to store and manipulate data in scripts and command-line operations. In this part of the project, I've explored:

- Creating and assigning values to variables
- Environment variables vs. local variables
- Variable expansion and substitution
- Using special variables like `$?`, `$$`, `$!`
- Arithmetic operations
