**Issue Summary:**

**Duration:**  
Start Time: May 4, 2024, 10:00 PM (EAT)  
End Time: May 5, 2024, 3:00 AM (EAT)

**Impact:**  
The outage affected the entire user base, resulting in a complete service downtime. Users experienced inability to access the platform, leading to a 100% user impact.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the outage was identified as a database overload due to a sudden surge in user activity combined with inefficient database query optimization.

**Timeline:**

- **10:15 PM (EAT):** Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating unusually high database latency.
- **10:20 PM (EAT):** Engineering team notified of the issue.
- **10:30 PM (EAT):** Initial investigation focused on database performance metrics and query execution times.
- **11:00 PM (EAT):** Assumed root cause was initially suspected to be a network bottleneck due to recent infrastructure upgrades.
- **11:30 PM (EAT):** Network team and database administrators were escalated to for further investigation.
- **12:00 AM (EAT):** Misleading path of investigating network configurations was abandoned after finding no anomalies.
- **1:00 AM (EAT):** Database administrators identified inefficient database queries as the likely culprit.
- **2:00 AM (EAT):** Engineers deployed temporary database optimizations to alleviate immediate strain.
- **3:00 AM (EAT):** Service was restored after implementing short-term solutions.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

**Root Cause Explanation:**  
The database overload stemmed from poorly optimized queries, resulting in excessive resource consumption and degraded performance.

**Resolution:**  
The issue was addressed through a combination of query optimization, database index improvements, and scaling database resources to handle increased load. Additionally, long-term measures were implemented to enhance database query efficiency and scalability.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

**Improvements/Fixes:**
- Implement comprehensive query optimization strategies.
- Enhance database monitoring and alerting systems to proactively identify performance issues.
- Conduct regular performance audits and optimizations to ensure scalability and reliability.

**Tasks:**
1. Conduct a thorough review of all database queries for optimization opportunities.
2. Implement automated database performance tuning tools.
3. Enhance monitoring system to provide real-time visibility into database performance metrics.
4. Schedule regular database performance audits and optimizations as part of the maintenance plan.
5. Document and communicate best practices for query optimization to development teams.

By implementing these corrective measures and proactive strategies, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure a resilient and reliable platform for our users.
